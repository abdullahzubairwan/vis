# Intro

Visualizing the shift of political allegiance in Peninsular Malaysia.

# Challenge

I tried making a graph with 3 variables into a simple line plot that usually caters 2 variables.
Those variables are:

1.  Party (Y Axis and Colors)
2.  Government Status (Y Axis)
3.  Time (X Axis)

If I do the usual line plots, most of the line will overlap between one another. Hence I added a value data that can show their respective flow throughout the years

This visualization was made just for fun and exploration.
